# Object-Oriented Programming | Python Paintings (Under Construction)
This is a series of digital paintings done with the Python language. Everything was done using the Turtle module and with the concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP). These files were created for _Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp_ challenges, from the London App Brewery. This is where I learn.

Each directory is a small project.

Currently under construction.
