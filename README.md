# Object-Oriented Programming | Python Paintings 
This is a series of digital paintings done with the Python language. Everything was done using the Turtle module and the concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP). These files were created for Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp challenges, from the London App Brewery.

Each directory is a small project.

I hope this repository is helpful in some way.
